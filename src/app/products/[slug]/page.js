// export const revalidate = 30

// at runtime and then make it static page again by saving the cache. this code is default added by next js whenever it find a

// 1 . if we update data of any product, it will not get updated

// it will bring the data at that moment only. Next Js doesn't know in advance which id will be there
// or which product will be clicked but unlike product listing page it knows which api to be called and 
// provides all data at once and then will create listing page as SSG at build time


// can we make this product detail page also SSG ??
// yes by knowing all id we can build all detail pages by making api call at build time only,
// thus we dont need node server at run time to build this page
// so if we can have all products data and by doing map, we can use each product id and can build
// static pages using that id at build time, so here we go below:
// Note we can remove below function and it will be SSR page again.

// a normal js file like page.js is a SSG and anything like dynamic routes are SSR.

// if we add force-dynamic in normal page.js static file just for testing purpose, it wl build that also dynamic and not SSG
// so we only use this when we're creating static pages of dynamic route.

// force-dynamic or revalidate timer we only use when there's a dynamic route which is created as SSG by using getStaticParam
// so that we can update static pages even after its built
